# Comprehensive AI Fixes Testing

## Test Plan - All Fixes Verification

### **Test 1: Performance Optimization**

**Test**: Array operations should use efficient task fetching
**Before**: Fetched all tasks to find one task
**After**: Uses `getTaskById()` for single task lookup

**Verification**:

1. Add a tag to existing task
2. Check console logs - should show efficient lookup
3. No "fetching all tasks" log messages

---

### **Test 2: Title Extraction Quality**

**Test**: Task titles should be clean and actionable

**Test Cases**:

```
Input: "I need to call the dentist"
Expected: Title = "Call Dentist"

Input: "I should finish the quarterly report"
Expected: Title = "Quarterly Report"

Input: "Create a task for testing the new feature"
Expected: Title = "Test New Feature"

Input: "I need to review the budget for next month"
Expected: Title = "Budget Review" or "Monthly Budget Review"
```

**Verification**: Create tasks with these inputs and check titles in database

---

### **Test 3: Enhanced Context Resolution**

**Test**: Complex task references should resolve correctly

**Test Cases**:

```
Scenario 1: Keyword-based resolution
1. Create task: "Call dentist for checkup"
2. Say: "make the dentist task high priority"
Expected: Finds and updates the dentist task

Scenario 2: Multiple matches
1. Create tasks: "Dentist appointment", "Dentist follow-up"
2. Say: "update the dentist task"
Expected: Either picks most recent or asks for clarification

Scenario 3: Conversation context
1. Create task: "Prepare presentation"
2. Say: "that should be high priority"
Expected: Updates the presentation task
```

---

### **Test 4: Array Operations (Previously Fixed)**

**Test**: Adding/removing tags and locations

**Test Cases**:

```
1. Task has tags: ["health", "call"]
   Input: "add teeth tag"
   Expected: Tags become ["health", "call", "teeth"]

2. Task has tags: ["health", "call", "urgent"]
   Input: "remove urgent tag"
   Expected: Tags become ["health", "call"]

3. Task has locations: ["home"]
   Input: "add office location"
   Expected: Locations become ["home", "office"]
```

---

### **Test 5: Database Verification (Previously Fixed)**

**Test**: Operations should only claim success when database actually updates

**Test Cases**:

```
1. Mark task complete
   - AI should claim success only if status actually changes to "done"
   - Verify in database that status changed

2. Change priority
   - AI should claim success only if priority actually updates
   - Verify in database that priority changed

3. Update non-existent task
   - AI should honestly report failure
   - Should not claim false success
```

---

### **Test 6: Date Parsing (Previously Fixed)**

**Test**: Relative dates should calculate from current date

**Test Cases**:

```
Current date: 2025-01-13 (Monday)

Input: "due Friday"
Expected: 2025-01-17 (next Friday)

Input: "due next Monday"
Expected: 2025-01-20 (following Monday)

Input: "due tomorrow"
Expected: 2025-01-14 (Tuesday)
```

---

## Quick Test Commands

### **Manual Testing**:

```bash
# Start the app
npm run dev

# Test in chat interface:
1. "I need to call the dentist" (check title quality)
2. "add urgent tag to that task" (check array operations + context)
3. "make it high priority" (check context resolution)
4. "mark the dentist task as done" (check database verification)
```

### **Database Verification**:

```bash
# Check actual database state
curl -s http://localhost:5173/api/tasks | jq '.data[] | {id, title, status, priority, context_tags}' | head -5
```

---

## Success Criteria

### âœ… **All Tests Should Pass**:

1. **Performance**: No unnecessary bulk task fetching
2. **Title Quality**: Clean, actionable titles (not full sentences)
3. **Context Resolution**: Complex references work correctly
4. **Array Operations**: Smart add/remove/replace functionality
5. **Database Verification**: Only claim success when operations actually work
6. **Date Parsing**: Relative dates calculated from current date

### ðŸŽ¯ **Overall Result**:

- AI should be reliable and truthful
- Operations should actually work as claimed
- Natural language should be understood correctly
- Performance should be efficient
