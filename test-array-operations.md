# Array Operations Fix Test

## Problem

When user says "add teeth as a tag on the dentist task", the AI was replacing all existing tags with just ["teeth"] instead of adding "teeth" to existing tags like ["health", "call"].

## Root Cause

1. **AI Prompt Issue**: Examples showed replacement instead of addition
2. **Update Logic**: No smart array merging logic

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated AI Prompt Examples

```
- "Add health tag to that task" → intent: "update", context_tags_operation: "add", context_tags: ["health"], target_task_id: "task_id"
- "Remove work tag from that task" → intent: "update", context_tags_operation: "remove", context_tags: ["work"], target_task_id: "task_id"
- "Set tags to health and urgent" → intent: "update", context_tags_operation: "replace", context_tags: ["health", "urgent"], target_task_id: "task_id"
```

### 2. Added Smart Array Operations Logic

- **Add**: Merge new items with existing (no duplicates)
- **Remove**: Filter out specified items
- **Replace**: Replace entire array

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Add Tag

**Initial state**: Call Dentist task has tags ["health", "call"]
**User input**: "add teeth as a tag on the dentist task"
**Expected AI intent**:

```json
{
  "intent_type": "update",
  "parameters": {
    "target_task_id": "dentist_task_id",
    "context_tags_operation": "add",
    "context_tags": ["teeth"]
  }
}
```

**Expected result**: Tags become ["health", "call", "teeth"]

### Test Case 2: Remove Tag

**Initial state**: Call Dentist task has tags ["health", "call", "urgent"]
**User input**: "remove urgent tag from dentist task"
**Expected result**: Tags become ["health", "call"]

### Test Case 3: Replace Tags

**Initial state**: Call Dentist task has tags ["health", "call"]
**User input**: "set dentist task tags to medical and appointment"
**Expected result**: Tags become ["medical", "appointment"]

### Test Case 4: Add Location

**Initial state**: Task has locations ["home"]
**User input**: "add office location to that task"
**Expected result**: Locations become ["home", "office"]

## Implementation Status

✅ AI prompt updated with operation examples
✅ Smart array operations logic implemented
✅ Support for both context_tags and locations
✅ Duplicate prevention for add operations
✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Next Steps

- Test with real user interactions
- Monitor for edge cases
- Consider optimizing task fetching (currently fetches all tasks)
