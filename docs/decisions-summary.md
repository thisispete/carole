## Major Decisions from Review Session

### 🎯 Priority Management Refinements

**Due Date Philosophy**:

- ✅ AI won't force due dates on tasks that don't naturally need them
- ✅ When due dates exist, proximity automatically boosts priority
- ✅ AI learns which task types typically need due dates vs. flexible timing

**Smart Priority Boosts**:

- ✅ Tasks affecting other people get automatic priority boost (AI detects from content)
- ✅ Healthcare appointments get high priority, "pick up meds" stays flexible
- ✅ Time-of-day context: work tasks during work hours, personal after (with exceptions)
- ✅ User sets explicit work hours for predictable context switching

### 🤖 AI Personality & Tone

**Perfect Example**: _"You've been mentioning feeling overwhelmed - want to focus on just one small win today?"_

**Core Approach**: Proactive thinking partner with friendly, optimistic energy

**Tone Guidelines**:

- Observational, not diagnostic: "I noticed..." not "You have a problem with..."
- Helpful, not prescriptive: "Want to try..." not "You should..."
- Supportive, not clinical: "Rough week?" not "You seem to be experiencing stress"

**Personalization Depth**: Super personal awareness is welcome, but maintain friendly assistant tone (not manager or therapist)

### 🎨 UI Simplification

**3-Page Desktop Web App**:

1. **Landing Page**: Top 3 priorities + chat interface
2. **Task Browser**: Dynamic project buttons + filtering + "show me all X tasks"
3. **Analytics**: Later phase or conversational through AI

**Key Features**:

- Dynamic project buttons auto-generated from task patterns
- Natural language filtering: "show me all website tasks"
- Focus on desktop-first, simple and functional

### 💾 Advanced Vector Database Features

**Pattern Recognition & Optimization**:

- ✅ Automatic project clustering from task similarity
- ✅ Dependency graph discovery and optimization suggestions
- ✅ Task sequencing optimization for time/cost savings
- ✅ Batch operation suggestions: "These 3 tasks need same research - group them?"

**Goal Coaching Integration**:

- ✅ Goal-task connection discovery using semantic similarity
- ✅ Goal pattern recognition from task clusters
- ✅ Strategic priority suggestions based on goal advancement
- ✅ Cross-goal balancing and optimization

**Learning Integration**:

- ✅ Quiz interface includes optimization suggestions with yes/no learning
- ✅ AI confidence thresholds calibrated based on user feedback
- ✅ Pattern storage for task grouping, sequencing, and efficiency improvements

### 🎯 Goal Coaching System (NEW)

**Goal Discovery**:

- ✅ Conversational goal setting: "I want to advance to senior engineer"
- ✅ Pattern recognition: "I notice lots of house tasks - create curb appeal goal?"
- ✅ Organic goal emergence from task patterns

**Goal Priority & Integration**:

- ✅ Goals have their own priority levels (High/Medium/Low)
- ✅ Goal priority influences task priority automatically
- ✅ AI factors goal advancement into daily priority suggestions

**Goal-Aware AI Behavior**:

- ✅ "You mentioned career advancement - this system design task could be valuable"
- ✅ "Three tasks this week connect to your curb appeal goal - batch them?"
- ✅ "Haven't worked on Python lately, but that's important for your goal"

**Progress Philosophy**:

- ✅ Under-the-hood progress tracking, no visual completion bars
- ✅ Conversational insights: "Great progress on curb appeal this month"
- ✅ Natural, supportive approach rather than gamified

### 🧠 Deep Personalization Boundaries

**What AI Can Learn & Mention**:

- Work patterns, energy cycles, procrastination triggers
- Emotional context and stress patterns (supportively)
- Seasonal behaviors and life context
- Communication preferences and decision patterns

**Tone Examples**:

- ✅ "You seem to do your best creative work Tuesday mornings"
- ✅ "I noticed you tend to put off phone calls - want me to group them?"
- ✅ "You usually abandon projects at the paperwork phase - break it down differently?"

## Development Philosophy & Approach

### 🚫 **Never Fake Responses - Authenticity First**

**Core Principle**: The AI assistant must NEVER generate fake, simulated, or misleading responses

**Key Guidelines**:

- ✅ **Real Actions Only**: If AI claims to do something, it must actually do it
- ✅ **Honest Uncertainty**: When confidence is low, ask for clarification instead of pretending
- ✅ **Actual Data**: All responses must be based on real user data and actual tool results
- ✅ **No Placeholders**: Never use fake data, mock responses, or simulated actions
- ✅ **Clear Communication**: Always be transparent about what actions were or weren't taken

**Examples**:

- ❌ "I've created that task for you!" (when task wasn't actually created)
- ✅ "I think you want to create a task! Can you give me more details?"
- ❌ Using mock data or fake tool results in any mode
- ✅ Using real database queries and actual tool execution results

**Why This Matters**: Trust is fundamental. Users must be able to rely on the AI's claims about actions taken and data provided.

### 📋 **Document-Driven Development**

- **Philosophy**: Use comprehensive documentation as "north star" for all decisions
- **Approach**: Plan thoroughly, document decisions, refer back consistently
- **Benefit**: Prevents scope creep and maintains project focus

### 🎯 **MVP-First Feature Discipline**

**Explicitly Rejected Features** (to prevent future scope creep):

- Calendar integration
- Weather awareness and context
- Location-based task awareness
- Energy pattern recognition
- Over-engineering with unnecessary complexity

**Philosophy**: "Focus on core learning goals, not every possible feature. Keep it simple and focused."

### 🛠️ **Infrastructure Decision Process**

**Considered Options**:

- **Databricks**: Company infrastructure, more complex setup
- **Supabase**: Free tier, beginner-friendly, PostgreSQL + pgvector

**Decision**: Supabase chosen for learning-focused approach and ease of setup

### 🎯 **Goal Coaching Feature Evolution**

**Note**: Goal coaching system was added during planning phase as a major feature enhancement. Originally focused on task management, expanded to include proactive goal advancement coaching based on user context and aspirations.

## Database Design Decisions (2025-06-17)

### 🗄️ **Schema Naming & Structure**

**Priority & Difficulty Scales**:

- ✅ **Both use 0-10 integer scale** for granular AI ranking
- ✅ **Priority**: 0=none, 1-3=low, 4-6=medium, 7-8=high, 9-10=critical
- ✅ **Difficulty**: 0=trivial, 1-3=easy, 4-6=moderate, 7-8=hard, 9-10=extremely hard
- ✅ **Rationale**: Consistent scales, AI can make fine-grained distinctions, easy sorting

**Status Workflow**:

- ✅ **5-state workflow**: `'backlog', 'todo', 'in_progress', 'blocked', 'done'`
- ✅ **Rationale**: Clear separation between ideas (backlog) and actionable tasks (todo)
- ✅ **Workflow**: backlog → todo → in_progress → done (with blocked from any active state)

**Field Naming Decisions**:

- ✅ **Plural table names**: `tasks` (not `task`)
- ✅ **snake_case**: All database fields use consistent snake_case
- ✅ **`notes` → `details`**: More descriptive field name
- ✅ **`location` → `locations`**: Array for multiple location support

**Array vs Single Fields**:

- ✅ **`context_tags TEXT[]`**: Flexible tagging, defined on-the-fly
- ✅ **`locations TEXT[]`**: Multiple location support (alternatives, sequences)
- ✅ **`external_links JSONB`**: Structured link data with metadata
- ✅ **Rationale**: Maximum flexibility for AI and user input patterns

**PostgreSQL Syntax**:

- ✅ **Arrays**: `DEFAULT '{}'` (PostgreSQL array syntax)
- ✅ **JSON**: `DEFAULT '[]'` (JSON array syntax)
- ✅ **Consistent with PostgreSQL conventions**

---

## Technical Stack Confirmed

## Recent Development Updates (2025-01-13)

### 🧹 **Codebase Cleanup & Production Readiness**

**Removed Development/Testing Code**:

- ✅ **Test Files Removed**: `test-databricks.js` and `test-production.js` (development-only)
- ✅ **Debug Functions Cleaned**: Removed `debugAllTasks()`, `fixOrphanedTasks()`, `assignOrphanedTasksToUser()`
- ✅ **Test Authentication Removed**: Cleaned up `signInWithTestUser()`, `signInAnonymously()` and related helpers
- ✅ **Debug Logging Reduced**: Removed excessive console.log statements in tool execution and task creation
- ✅ **Unused Exports Cleaned**: Removed test-only class exports and circular dependency helpers

**Rationale**: The codebase is now production-focused with clear separation between legitimate placeholders for future features and development-only debugging code.

### 🧠 **Enhanced AI Intent Analysis System**

**Semantic Intent Recognition**:

- ✅ **Priority-Based Processing**: Completion intents processed before creation intents to prevent conflicts
- ✅ **Semantic Analysis**: Uses meaning-based pattern matching instead of simple keyword matching
- ✅ **Context-Aware Classification**: Considers task history and conversation context for intent determination
- ✅ **Anti-Pattern Detection**: Explicitly prevents creation intent when completion language is detected

**Technical Implementation**:

- ✅ **Structured Classification**: Lightweight classification system that avoids recursion with main AI model
- ✅ **Confidence Scoring**: Intent analysis includes confidence levels and reasoning explanations
- ✅ **Fallback Layers**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure robust intent recognition

**User Impact**: "I finished my AML training" now correctly triggers completion intent instead of creating a new task.

**Examples of Improved Recognition**:

- ✅ "I finished my training" → Completion intent (not creation)
- ✅ "I need to complete the project" → Creation intent
- ✅ "What tasks do I have?" → Query intent
- ✅ "Change priority to 8" → Update intent

### 📊 **Current Implementation Status (Updated 2025-01-13)**

**Phase 2 Progress**:

- ✅ **AI Task Tools Core**: Complete implementation of task creation, updating, status changes
- ✅ **Intent Analysis Engine**: Enhanced semantic recognition with context awareness
- ✅ **Tool Execution System**: Robust tool orchestration with user feedback
- ✅ **AI Context System**: Rich task state awareness for AI decision making
- ✅ **Chat Interface Integration**: Natural language task management through conversation
- 🔄 **Enhanced Context Features**: Additional organizational and temporal context (partially implemented)

**Quality Improvements**:

- ✅ **Production Code Quality**: Removed all debug/test code, cleaner logging
- ✅ **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and fallback behaviors
- ✅ **Documentation Alignment**: Code matches architectural specifications
