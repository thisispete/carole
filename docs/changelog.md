## [Phase 2: AI-Driven Extraction] - 2025-01-XX ✅ COMPLETED

### 🎉 **Major Milestone: AI-Driven System Active**

**Phase 2 successfully replaced hard-coded business logic with intelligent AI analysis.**

### ✅ **Added**

- **AI-Powered Intent Recognition**: Replaces rule-based pattern matching with contextual AI analysis
- **Enhanced Organizational Context**: Comprehensive company policies, mandatory training, regulatory requirements
- **Intelligent Priority Determination**: AI understands business consequences and regulatory deadlines
- **Real Task Data Integration**: Accurate reporting of actual task data instead of hallucinated responses
- **Context-Aware Task Creation**: Considers user role, department, workload, and business priorities

### ❌ **Removed**

- **Hard-coded Business Rules**: Eliminated brittle pattern matching (`if (message.includes("training"))`)
- **Rule-based Priority Logic**: Removed `determineTaskPriorityWithAI` and `fallbackPriorityDetermination` methods
- **Test Functions**: Cleaned up debug buttons and testing code from production interface
- **Fake Response Generation**: No more AI claiming to create tasks with wrong priorities

### 🔧 **Changed**

- **Intent Recognition**: `intentRecognizer.analyzeIntent()` → `toolExecutor.analyzeIntent()` (async AI-driven)
- **Response Generation**: Now uses real task data from database instead of generic tool messages
- **Priority Calculation**: AI analyzes organizational context instead of keyword matching
- **User Interface**: Clean production interface with AI system status display

### 🐛 **Fixed**

- **Task Priority Mismatch**: AI now creates tasks with correct priorities (AML training = Priority 10)
- **Response Accuracy**: AI reports actual task data instead of making up details
- **Context Awareness**: System understands "this week" + "AML training" = urgent compliance deadline
- **Business Logic Maintenance**: Centralized organizational policies instead of scattered rules

### 📊 **Key Metrics**

- **Accuracy Improvement**: AML training now correctly identified as Priority 10 (was Priority 5)
- **Code Reduction**: Removed ~500 lines of hard-coded rule logic
- **Maintainability**: Business policies now configurable without code changes
- **Intelligence**: AI understands regulatory consequences and business context

### 🏗️ **Technical Changes**

- Enhanced `AIIntentRecognizer` with comprehensive context prompting
- Updated `databricksService.ts` to use AI-driven intent analysis
- Improved `aiEnhancedContext.ts` with detailed organizational knowledge
- Streamlined `+page.svelte` for production readiness

**Impact**: The system now intelligently understands business context instead of relying on brittle pattern matching. When a user says "I need to finish my AML training this week", the AI correctly identifies this as a mandatory compliance task with legal consequences, assigns Priority 10, and sets an appropriate deadline.
