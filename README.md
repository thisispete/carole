# Carole - AI Personal Assistant & Project Manager

A proactive AI assistant designed to learn vector databases, AI personalization, and advanced task management patterns.

## Project Overview

Carole is an AI-powered personal assistant that goes beyond reactive chat interfaces to actively manage tasks, priorities, and project workflows. The system learns user patterns and provides intelligent, contextual assistance for both personal and professional task management.

### Key Learning Goals

- **Vector Database Implementation**: Practical applications using Supabase pgvector
- **AI Agent Personalization**: Building AI that adapts to user preferences
- **Proactive AI Design**: AI that initiates conversations and provides value
- **Hybrid Data Architecture**: Combining structured and unstructured data patterns

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit + shadcn-svelte
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- **AI**: Company LLM infrastructure (Bedrock)
- **Deployment**: Supabase hosting

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Proactive Priority Management

- AI presents top 3 priorities immediately on app open
- Learns user priority patterns over time
- Handles both simple todos and complex hierarchical projects

### ðŸ§  Intelligent Task Management

- Natural language task creation through chat
- Automatic task breakdown and subtask suggestion
- Dependency tracking with conflict detection
- Mixed context support (work + personal)

### ðŸ’¬ Conversational Interface

- Full conversation memory using vector storage
- Semantic search across all past interactions
- Rapid-fire quiz interface for quick priority setting
- Context-aware AI responses

### ðŸ”— Smart Dependencies

- Visual dependency relationship tracking
- Automatic priority propagation for blocking tasks
- Circular dependency detection and prevention
- Conflict resolution suggestions

## Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation & MVP (In Progress)  
**Completed**:

- âœ… SvelteKit project setup with TypeScript
- âœ… 3-page application structure (Landing, Tasks, Analytics)
- âœ… Basic UI components and routing
- âœ… Priority dashboard UI with sample data
- âœ… Task browser with filtering and sample tasks
- âœ… Chat interface UI ready for AI integration

**Next Steps**:
