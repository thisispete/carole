## [Version 1.0.0] - 2024-12-19

### 🎉 Initial Release

**FOUNDATION RELEASE**: Core SvelteKit application with Supabase integration

### ✨ Features Launched

- **SvelteKit Application**: TypeScript-based web application
- **Supabase Integration**: PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security
- **Task Management**: Basic CRUD operations for tasks
- **3-Page Structure**: Landing, Tasks, Analytics
- **Priority System**: 0-10 scale with visual indicators
- **Status Workflow**: 5-state task workflow (backlog → todo → in_progress → blocked → done)

## Evolution Summary

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **SvelteKit over React**: Chosen for simplicity and learning focus
2. **Supabase over Custom Backend**: Faster setup for MVP development
3. **AI-Only Approach**: No hardcoded business logic - all through LLM intelligence
4. **Stability over Bleeding Edge**: Tailwind v3.4.0 chosen over v4.x for reliability

### Major Architecture Shifts

1. **Phase 1**: Basic web app with database
2. **Phase 2**: AI integration with chat interface
3. **Phase 3**: Sophisticated AI tool system with intent recognition
4. **Current**: Production-ready with reliability improvements

### Critical Lessons Learned

- **Environment Stability**: Development tools must be rock solid before feature development
- **AI Authenticity**: Never fake responses - all AI claims must be backed by real actions
- **Incremental Complexity**: Build simple foundation first, add intelligence incrementally
- **Service Resilience**: External dependencies require retry logic and error handling
